# E-commerce-Entreprenreur-Site
My web associate work at Danielle Brody Media to build a profitable and enchanting website. The site is fully functionable for a pleasant shopping experience with hovering buttons, blog access, exclusive membership access, the ability to purchase items, and leave reviews.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP

In JavaScript, I made APIs and polyfills to ensure every button and link are clicakble or hoverable when the user prompts the action to do so. Functions and "what if" statements are written for multiple scenario outcomes. In CSS, images, GIFS, and color schemes were used to create a bubble gum-themed design, infused with fonts that Wix provides. THe HTML includes meta properties, names, and scripts. The site works on both desktop and mobile app where the layouts are aligned and edited. 

## Optimizations

The prior Danielle Brody Media website had a plethera of quirks with broken links, unreadable content, and poor app performance. I was able to increase the speed of the website as well as utilize my UX/UI skills to sharpen the brand image. There are more interactable functionalities, such as adding one's contact information in the e-mail newsletter. Site visitors can leave comments, react, and feedback in addition to being able to shop more item availabilities. 

## Lessons Learned:

I learned the coding and designing process are less of a sprint and more of a marathon. I learned how to work better across the front end and back end between languages because, prior to this project endeavor, I have usually worked with a portion of a project. The third and final lesson are being comfortable with using aysnc in JavaScript.
